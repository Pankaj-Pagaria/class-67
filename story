** story **
Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree which was the bank of the river 
in the forest. There lived a crocodile and his wife. So one day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
